# Intelligence Evolution Analysis: OpenCode vs Our Approach

## Definition of System Intelligence

**System Intelligence** = The ability to:
1. Understand complex user intent
2. Break down problems into steps
3. Execute multi-step solutions
4. Learn from context
5. Coordinate multiple capabilities
6. Self-correct and adapt

## OpenCode's Intelligence Architecture

### Current Intelligence Level: **HIGH** (8/10)

**Strengths:**
1. **Deep Agent Specialization**
   - Different agents for different tasks
   - Agents can spawn sub-agents
   - Hierarchical problem solving

2. **Rich Context Passing**
   ```typescript
   Context {
     sessionID, messageID, agent, callID,
     abort, metadata, extra
   }
   ```
   - Every tool knows its full context
   - Can reference previous operations
   - Abortable operations

3. **Session Hierarchy**
   - Parent-child sessions
   - Context inheritance
   - Result aggregation up the tree

4. **Tool Composition**
   - Tools can call other tools
   - Complex workflows possible
   - State shared across tools

5. **Planning & Execution**
   - Dedicated planning prompts
   - Build mode switching
   - Task decomposition

### Intelligence Bottlenecks:
- **Over-structured** - Too rigid for creative problem solving
- **CLI-focused** - Limited by terminal interface
- **File-centric** - Intelligence tied to code editing

## Our Approach's Intelligence Evolution

- No context between tools
- Single-shot responses

### Phase 2 (Week 2): **MODERATE** (5/10)
- Todo persistence
- Event streaming
- Tool awareness of each other
- Basic chaining

### Phase 3 (Week 3): **GOOD** (7/10)
- Session context sharing
- Agent personas
- Tool permissions
- Workflow templates

### Phase 4 (Month 2): **HIGH** (8/10)
- Multi-agent coordination
- Learning from patterns
- Conditional execution
- Self-modification

### Phase 5 (Month 3): **VERY HIGH** (9/10)
- Meta-planning (plans about plans)
- Self-improving workflows
- Cross-session learning
- Autonomous goal pursuit

## Key Intelligence Differentiators

### OpenCode's Intelligence is **Deep but Narrow**
```
Great at: Code editing, file manipulation, CLI operations
Poor at: Web tasks, data analysis, creative work, learning
```

### Our Intelligence will be **Broad and Adaptive**
```
Great at: Any web task, data analysis, content creation, learning
Growing: Code assistance, specialized domains
```

## Why Our Approach Has Higher Intelligence Potential

### 1. **Web-Native = Richer Interactions**
- OpenCode: Limited to terminal I/O
- Ours: Rich UI, visualizations, real-time feedback

### 2. **Incremental = Faster Evolution**
- OpenCode: Big architecture slows innovation
- Ours: Ship, learn, adapt quickly

### 3. **User-Facing = Real Intelligence Feedback**
- OpenCode: Developer-focused intelligence
- Ours: End-user feedback drives smarter features

### 4. **Flexible Foundation**
- OpenCode: Locked into CLI paradigm
- Ours: Can evolve in any direction

### 5. **Learning-Oriented Architecture**
```typescript
// OpenCode: Static agents
const agent = getAgent('general');

// Ours: Evolving intelligence
const agent = await selectBestAgent(context, userHistory, taskType);
agent.learn(outcome);
```

## Conclusion

OpenCode built a **highly intelligent but specialized** system - like a chess grandmaster who can only play chess.

We're building an **evolving general intelligence** - like a smart student who starts simple but can learn anything.

**The key insight:** Intelligence isn't about complexity on day one. It's about:
1. **Learning velocity** - How fast can it improve?
2. **Adaptation range** - What can it learn to do?
3. **Feedback loops** - How quickly does it learn from users?

Our simpler start with faster iteration will overtake OpenCode's intelligence within 3 months and surpass it significantly within 6 months.

### Final Score:
- **OpenCode**: A+ for specialized CLI intelligence, C for evolution potential
- **Our Approach**: C for day-one intelligence, A+ for evolution velocity and potential
