# Cognitive Implementation: Bridging Theory to Practice

## The Synthesis

After analyzing OpenCode and first principles of intelligence, here's how we build Step 1 with cognitive foundations:

## Step 1: Planning Tool with Cognitive Architecture

Instead of a simple linear planner, we build a **hypothesis-generating planner** from day one.

### Traditional Planning (What OpenCode Does):
```typescript
// Linear, single path
const plan = generatePlan(task);
const result = executePlan(plan);
```

### Cognitive Planning (What We'll Build):
```typescript
// Multiple hypotheses, even in simplest form
const hypotheses = generateMultiplePlans(task);
const selected = evaluatePlans(hypotheses);
const result = executeWithConfidence(selected);
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Cognitive Primitives (Even in Step 1):

```typescript
// lib/omni/cognitive/types.ts
interface Hypothesis {
  id: string;
  approach: string;
  steps: Step[];
  confidence: number;
  rationale: string;
}

interface CognitiveState {
  task: string;
  hypotheses: Hypothesis[];
  selected: Hypothesis | null;
  evidence: Evidence[];
}
```

### The Planning Tool - Cognitive from Day 1:

```typescript
// lib/omni/tools/plan.ts
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Even simple planning maintains multiple hypotheses internally
export const planTool = tool({
  description: 'Create and evaluate multiple planning approaches',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    task: z.string(),
    mode: z.enum(['explore', 'exploit']).default('explore')
  }),
  execute: async ({ task, mode }) => {
    // COGNITIVE FOUNDATION: Generate multiple approaches
    const hypotheses = await generateHypotheses(task);
    
    // COGNITIVE FOUNDATION: Evaluate and rank
    const ranked = evaluateHypotheses(hypotheses);
    
    // COGNITIVE FOUNDATION: Select based on confidence
    const selected = mode === 'explore' 
      ? selectExplorative(ranked)  // Try less certain but potentially better
      : selectExploitative(ranked); // Use most confident
    
    // COGNITIVE FOUNDATION: Track for learning
    trackDecision({ task, hypotheses, selected });
    
    return {
      selected: selected.steps,
      alternatives: ranked.slice(0, 2).map(h => h.approach),
      confidence: selected.confidence,
      rationale: selected.rationale
    };
  }
});
```

## Why This Matters

### Day 1 (Simple but Cognitive):
- Generates 3 plans instead of 1
- Tracks confidence
- Has explore/exploit mode
- Remembers decisions

### Month 1 (Same Foundation, More Sophisticated):
- Generates 10+ plans
- Uses pattern matching from memory
- Adjusts confidence based on outcomes
- Learns optimal explore/exploit ratio

### Month 3 (Same Foundation, True Intelligence):
- Monte Carlo Tree Search for plan generation
- Simulates outcomes before committing
- Meta-reasoning about planning approach
- Self-improving strategy selection

## The Key Insight

We're not building a simple tool then adding intelligence later. We're building an **intelligent tool that starts simple**.

The cognitive architecture is there from day one:
1. **Multiple hypotheses** (even if just 2-3)
2. **Confidence tracking** (even if basic)
3. **Mode selection** (explore vs exploit)
4. **Learning hooks** (even if just logging)

## Step-by-Step Cognitive Implementation

### Step 1: Cognitive Planning Tool (2 hours)
```typescript
lib/omni/
├── cognitive/
│   └── types.ts        # Hypothesis, CognitiveState
└── tools/
    └── plan.ts         # Multi-hypothesis planner
```

### Step 2: Cognitive Todo Tool (2 hours)
```typescript
// Not just CRUD, but priority prediction
export const todoTool = tool({
  execute: async ({ action, content }) => {
    if (action === 'create') {
      // COGNITIVE: Predict priority based on similar tasks
      const priority = predictPriority(content);
      // COGNITIVE: Suggest related todos
      const related = suggestRelated(content);
    }
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Cognitive Memory (2 hours)
```typescript
// Not just storage, but pattern extraction
class CognitiveMemory {
  store(item: any) {
    const pattern = extractPattern(item);
    const similar = findSimilar(pattern);
    updatePatternStrength(pattern, similar);
  }
}
```

## The Cognitive Difference

### Without Cognitive Foundations:
- Step 1: Simple planner
- Step 10: Try to add intelligence (hard!)
- Step 20: Still struggling with bolt-on intelligence

### With Cognitive Foundations:
- Step 1: Simple but cognitive planner
- Step 10: Same architecture, smarter decisions
- Step 20: Emergent intelligence from accumulated patterns

## Practical Benefits Even in Week 1

1. **User sees alternatives**: "I considered 3 approaches, here's why I chose this one"
2. **Confidence indication**: "I'm 80% confident in this plan"
3. **Exploration mode**: "Let me try a creative approach"
4. **Learning readiness**: Every decision tracked for future improvement

## Next Steps

1. Implement cognitive planning tool (Step 1)
2. Test with real tasks in chat
3. Add cognitive todo tool (Step 2)
4. Connect them cognitively (Step 3)

Each step is still 2-4 hours, still atomic, but with intelligence built in from the start.
