Based on my analysis of OpenCode, here are the core patterns we should adapt for your project:

  1. Multi-Agent Architecture

  - Primary Agents: Main agents (build, plan)
  - Subagents: Specialized agents (general, specific tasks)
  - Agent Registry: Dynamic discovery and registration
  - Each agent has permissions, tools, models, and prompts

  2. Event-Driven Bus System

  - Central event bus for all communication
  - Pub/sub pattern for decoupling
  - Events for session updates, errors, tool execution
  - Real-time updates across components

  3. Tool Management

  - Tool Registry: Central registry for all tools
  - Dynamic Tool Loading: Tools from files, MCP, plugins
  - Tool Composition: Tools can call other tools (task spawns subagents)
  - Metadata & Streaming: Tools return structured output with metadata

  4. Session Management

  - Parent-child session hierarchy
  - Session state persistence
  - Message streaming with parts
  - Abort/resume capabilities

  5. MCP Integration (Identical to yours!)

  - StreamableHTTPClientTransport for remote
  - StdioClientTransport for local
  - Dynamic tool discovery
  - Fallback transports (HTTP â†’ SSE)

  6. Task/Subagent Tool

  - Spawns child sessions with specialized agents
  - Passes context and inherits permissions
  - Returns aggregated results
  - Event-driven updates during execution

  7. Todo Management

  - Session-scoped todo lists
  - Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed)
  - Priority levels
  - Used for planning and tracking

  8. Planning System

  - Dedicated planning agent
  - Structured prompts for planning
  - Todo list integration
  - Step-by-step execution
